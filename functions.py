# If test_double_one had been the only testing function, the tests would have passed the first time.
# Would that have meant that the code was correct? While waiting to demonstrate completion of the lab,
# ponder how many tests one might need to sufficiently test this function.
#
# It would mean that the code was correct according to the tests, but the tests wouldn't
# fully represent the intended functionality of the code.
